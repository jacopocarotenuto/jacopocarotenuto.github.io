I'm a third year physics student at the University of Padua. I'm passionate about programming and physics, especially where this two wonderful fields intersects.
In the years I took part in a number of interesting projects and I'm always in search of a good challenge. 
I'm also a proud member of the scouts, one of the chiefs of my local detachment.
I always love learning new things, especially new skills and abilities, and I make a priority of always learning something, no matter how small or silly it might be: juggling, machine learning, the one-leg squat or advanced graph theory. All is interesting to me.

Feel free to reach out for anything!
